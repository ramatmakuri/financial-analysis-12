Logistic Regression - Credit Risk Problem - Imbalanced Sample


In this assigmnment, financial Python programming skills will be used with logistic regression analysis to tackle a credit classification problem. Credit risk poses a classification problem thatâ€™s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this assignment, used various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. For this purpose I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Data source: CSV file

The steps followed are:

1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

2. Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

3. Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

4. Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

Packages Used This project leverages python 3.7
